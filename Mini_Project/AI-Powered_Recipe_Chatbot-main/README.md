## Getting Started

To get started with the AI-Powered Recipe Chatbot, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
- **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
- **MongoDB** (for local development, or use MongoDB Atlas for a cloud database)
- **React** (for frontend development)
- **Rasa/Dialogflow** (for NLP framework)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/AI-Powered-Recipe-Chatbot.git
cd AI-Powered-Recipe-Chatbot
```

2. **Install dependencies for both frontend and backend**:

- Frontend:
  ```bash
  cd frontend
  npm install
  ```

- Backend:
  ```bash
  cd backend
  npm install
  ```

3. **Set up environment variables** (for database and API keys):
   - Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add necessary keys:
     ```bash
     MONGO_URI=your_mongo_database_uri
     ```

4. **Run the backend server**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   node index.js
   ```

5. **Run the frontend server**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

The application should now be live at `http://localhost:3000` (or another specified port).
